## Description

Travelmate is an application designed to help users search for, and save within their personal profile, activities happening in their travel destinations.  They are able to see the name of the event, a photo, the venue, date, and a link for more information.

Using this application, the user will be able to organize and plan their trips more efficiently.

This project taught us about the work required to build a full-stack website, how well the project needs to be thought through, and how important communication is between all the team members in the project.  The ambitious scope of this project created a lot more work than anticipated, and there were several components to the project that were not originally assigned to group members as well as some unforseen circumstances for individual members.  This made it difficult to complete the project to our imagined specifications.

## Future Development

We would like to finish develping the basic functionality and styling of the site, as there are some remaining issues to address.  One of the challenges of this project ended up being the size and the desired functionality.  The more we built, the more we discovered needed to be built.

Future developments to this application include adding restaurant and accommodation information, weather information, currency exchange rates, and local transportation options to the user's search.  We would also like to add filters, sot the user can filter the search results for interests and budget.  We also plan to add the ability for the user to share their itinerary with family and friends, and to allow collaboration between users to make changes and updates to planned trips.
